# Idempotent Event Consumer

This sample uses Quarkus, Hibernate, MySQL, and Apache Kafka to implement a Kafka event consumer that detects and discards duplicate events coming from a Kafka topic.

Underneath, it maintains a MySQL table called 'consumed_messages' to store successfully processed messages. When a new message arrives, the consumer logic checks this table for the existence of the message ID. If yes, the processing is ignored, otherwise, the message will be processed and its ID will be inserted to the consumed_messages table.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/hibernate-orm-mysql-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
